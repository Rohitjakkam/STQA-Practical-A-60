Review: The overall experience was awesome,I would rate 8.7 on a scale of 10.The best parts of this laptop:1. Display: 144hz smooth display2. Keyboard: Backlit and best designed keyboard3. Gaming experience: No lag as it comes with 16gb Ram and 4gb RTX Graphic card.4. Transfer speed: The file transferred can be seen in an Image I've shared (C to C SSD).5. Ports: All the needful ports are provided, RJ45 port is eisely fitted in!6. Design: the laptop is designed so well, nice & attractive7. Overall experience: Best piece available on this price range...Some of things I didn't liked:1. Screen Wobble.2. Blue color is bit not good, black is preferable.3. Battery life is max to max 3 hrs. of light-mid performance tasks.4. The adapter is good and super fast charging speed type (200W) but its too heavy to carry. (Laptop weight is acceptable around 2.3kg).I would heavily recommend:Keep a cotton or thin cloth in between of screen and keyboard when you close your laptop, otherwise it will leave keyboard's dust spots on your screen which is not cleanable easily.Thanks!

Review: After using this laptop for more than a year, here's my review:Good laptop if you mostly want to play games, doing some heavy workload and/or occasionally some MS Office related stuff. But for me personally, it has got some issues.The touchpad works fine for some time and then it's starts having input lag. Like, there's a noticeable delay between swiping the finger and mouse pointer moving on the screen. It's really annoying when I have to precisely click on small things.The temporary soluton I got is, I disable and re-enable the touchpad using the hotkey on the keyboard. But it doesn't work forever, sometimes I have to do it again after a few seconds.The build quality isn't that great either, especially the hinge.If you live in a hot climate and have a fan blowing air from the side. The screen is going to wobble and steal your attention from whatever important stuff you might be doing.And if the wobbling thing can't steal your precious attention, then probably the sparkly backlit keyboard would. Especially, if you place the laptop on table a little bit far away with lights off at night. It's bright and there's no option to dim it.Also, If you're going to daily drive it to take it on work through public transport with the bag hanging on your shoulders for half an hour, then you're probably going to regret getting this 2.5 KG laptop.Otherwise, the performance is great for a laptop for this price range.TL;DRThis laptop is good as a tabletop with an external mouse. Otherwise buy a desktop.

Review: I’ve been using the HP Victus for a variety of tasks, including gaming, video editing, and basic office work, and overall, I’m impressed. Its gaming capability is excellent, handling demanding games like Red Dead Redemption 2 smoothly without any issues.For a gaming laptop, the battery life is surprisingly good. The 70Wh battery lasts up to 4 hours when performing lighter tasks, which is more than I expected. The only downside is the sound quality, which is quite average, but that’s manageable if you’re using headphones or external speakers.Overall, a solid choice for gamers and power users alike.

Review: Ordered this lap on 29/7/2024Got delivered on 30th and the laptop was working fine for two days, we got the gmail setup done, then on aug 3 the display started to not work. This was reported to customer support on 3rd aug itself, now it is 12th aug still no proper response from Amazon, the lap is just sitting in the box of no use. Huge amount of money been spent on this and Amazon is not giving a crap on thisI contacted Customer support 6 times and explained the issues that many times to each individual to make them understand the issue and what I've been facing all these days. Poor response from Amazon, and im starting to lose hope on this. NOT SURE what to do with the defective laptop.
