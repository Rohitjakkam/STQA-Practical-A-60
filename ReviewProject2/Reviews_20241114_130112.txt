    *****DO NOT TRY THE METHOD IN VIDEO YOURSELF, CALL A KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON TO CHECK*****- Purchased it on 28 December 2021.- Called butterfly aftersales service on 9-Mar and reported gas leakage after getting the cylinder and regulator checked with gas cylinder provider.- Service person came and checked. He reported that the grease was dried out from left most knob that is why this is happening. He greased it and completed the service.- Called butterfly aftersales service again on 18- Mar and reported gas leakage.- Service person came and checked. All knobs were leaking. He changed the mechanical mechanism behind all the knobs and said now this will not happen.- Called butterfly aftersales service again on 30-Apr and reported gas leakage. This time I insisted that I need a replacement as this seems to be a defective product but the person on other side said that company have no policy for replacement. I agreed to have it serviced again.- Service person came and checked. He said there is no problem in the gas stove, there is no leakage. He claimed that if there is any leakage then it would be consistent, not random.- Today 03-May, Smell is coming again and you can see the same in video that the gas is leaking from the knob.It is happening just in 4 months of use. This is firstly a life threatening problem and secondly service charges are not applicable as it is under warranty as of now but what after warranty, you will just pay service charges for fixing it again and again.This problem still persists, I don't know what to do with this faulty gas stove as I am unable to get a replacement or refund or even a permanent fix. It is total waste of money + time.I have placed a service request for last time now, I am hoping for a better resolution. I will update afterwards.Update:Now the whole under the hood mechanism has been replaced by the technician and it is working fine. Still, had to go through so much pain for a simple problem so I will not increase the rating.
